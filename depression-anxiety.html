        <p class="depression-text">
          Depression is an abnormal exhibition of a lessened mood affecting how
          you feel and think and in turn to that how you behave as a person.
          According to the world health organization, approximately 4.4 percent
          of the world’s population lives with depression.
        </p>
        <p class="depression-text m-text">
          Sadness is a reaction due to the outcome of depression. The difference
          between sadness and other emotions is that the person avoids taking
          any sort of action. This causes the person to go into endless thought
          loops which in the long run does more harm rather than give a
          solution.
        </p>
        <p class="depression-text">
          The brain is prone to think that there isn’t a productive solution and
          leaves the person hopeless, ultimately putting the person in a
          depressive state.

          towards yourself and the situation you are going through.

              <p>
                Exercise is known to increase levels of serotonin and dopamine
                in the brain which can increase feelings of happiness and
                satisfaction which in turn keeps the mind away from thinking of
                fear.

                With CBT you learn to identify and challenge your fearful
                thoughts patterns and replace them with positive more realistic
                ones.
